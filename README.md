Built for OSU Summer 2020 Hackathon

Approximately 8 percent of the population are color blind. Our goal is to create a web app that tests if a combination of colors is color-blind friendly or will present conflicting colors. It can be a useful tool for web designers to quickly test a series of colors that they wish to use, it can also be used to test a web page via a url. The web app will then mark conflicting color and suggest alternatives.
